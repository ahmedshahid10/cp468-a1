This is our assignment 1 for CP468 class. 

Some rules to remember when using GitHub so you can avoid errors and not ruin the code :) 

    - ALWAYS Fetch -> Pull BEFORE you Push your code cause it wont let you push any code unless you have the latest code pulled first 
    - If you want to pull the code first before pushing to test out features or whatever, when you pull, it will tell you to merge the code. MAKE SURE YOUR CODE IS NOT DELEED/REPLACED WHEN MERGING OTHERS CODE ONTO YOURS 
    - Do not push ANY codes that are giving you errors. It will just give everyone errors. Just let us know when you have an error and we will figure it out together wihtout needing to put everyone through the delay 
    - Please leave comments and descriptions when you push your code. It could be literally one word or a sentence. Doesnt matter. Just dont leave it blank.
